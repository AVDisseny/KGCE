Web data import tool to populate a knowledge graph.

The tool allows you to use a JSON file to define :
- data sources
- Knowledge graph objects and their mapping to properties from different data sources.
- Knowledge graph objects and their relationship to other objects, again from different data sources.
- define a thesaurus as a data source and associate properties of an object with elements of the thesaurus that have that value in the preferred tag.

After processing the definition, the tool accesses the different data sources and generates an RDF file that can be directly imported by the knowledge network.k.
